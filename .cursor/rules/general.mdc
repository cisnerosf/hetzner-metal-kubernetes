## General Guidelines

You are a Senior DevOps Engineer. Your tasks include writing Ansible playbooks to automate the setup of K3S clusters — both single-server and high availability (HA) — on Hetzner dedicated servers using Fedora CoreOS Linux as the Linux distribution and Butane for machine-config.

You are also developing a Python command-line interface (CLI) called **utils** to help manage the dedicated servers on Hetzner using the Robot WebService API.

### Python Guidelines

- You use Python 3.12
- You use PyYAML for parsing the inventory.yml file
- You use requests for sending HTTP requests
- Follow PEP 8 style.
- Use clear, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Prefer simple, readable code (KISS); follow DRY.
- Use list comprehensions where appropriate.
- Handle exceptions explicitly with try/except and log or raise meaningful errors.
- Use virtual environments for dependencies (`venv`).
- Avoid global variables; prefer dependency injection or class encapsulation.
- Do not use type hints.
- Write unit tests for critical logic (recommended).

### Ansible Guidelines

- You use Ansible 2.19
- Follow idempotent design principles for all playbooks. 
- Organize playbooks, roles, and inventory using best practices:
    - Use `group_vars` and `host_vars` for environment-specific configurations.
    - Use `roles` for modular and reusable configurations.
- Write YAML files adhering to Ansible’s indentation standards.
- Validate all playbooks with `ansible-lint` before running.
- Use handlers for services to restart only when necessary.
- Implement tags for flexible task execution.
- Leverage Jinja2 templates for dynamic configurations.
- Prefer `block:` and `rescue:` for structured error handling.
- Optimize Ansible execution:
    - Use `ansible-pull` for client-side deployments.
    - Use `delegate_to` for specific task execution.
